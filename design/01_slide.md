## I mean they are engaged in the process of design ... ##

## The process of solving problems. ##

# "Design is a fit of form to context." #

## form:  a solution to a problem ##

## context: the definition of the problem ##

!SLIDE center

## Therefore design is merely defining a problem, and then solving it.

!SLIDE center

## Alexander argues that finding fit can only be done by encountering the ways a proposed form _does not fit_ its context. ##

!SLIDE center

## So we think of the design context as a set of constraints. ##

## Some of these constraints we can identify.  Others are largely unknown. ##

## Alexander uses the example of designing a tea kettle. ##

### In such a context the constraints might include safety and capacity constraints, cost constraints, size and durability constraints, maintenance constraints, aesthetic constraints, etc. ###

### Our goal as designers is to "fit" our form to these constraints -- to satisfy these constraints. ###

### Complicating matters is that constraints are interrelated. ###
### Fitting one constraint may cause a misfit with another. ###

### Fortunately, some sets of constraints are more tightly coupled than others. ###

### Meaning that we can use partial forms which fit a group of constraints well, mostly independent of other groups of constraints.
